# Purpose

This document details the basics and essentials of managing, adding, and extracting data in the Grady Lab postgreSQL server.

The server contains data bases for management of records, documents, and data concerning patients and samples from various consortia.

Two key aspects to the database are: 
1. Static storage (inc. its formatting, relations, and layout); 
2. Dynamic data access (inc. Views and associated SQL scripts, functions, indecies, and other ephemera that are generated secondarily to static data)

The two aspects are clearly distinct but also closely related. 
Concerns with 1. include maximizing efficiency and ease of data access, management, and additions. 
Concerns with 2 are related to the data structures and relations from 1. 
Hence, the goal is to optimize static storage while also ensuring dynamic access needs are met.

# Document Layout:
## I. Introduction

Plans and proposals for document updates. 

# I. Introduction

PostgreSQL (or PGSQL, pgsql, etc.) is an extension of the traditional Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). It introduces additional functionality such as support for additional schema objects, data types, and dynamics, including arrays, inheritence, and functions. These extensions make it a powerful Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS).

PGSQL databases consist of schemas, which organize data into varying types. The most important is, of course the table, which is the object where data entries are stored. Additional objects include Views, which generate so-called pseudo-tables based on query and script definitions. Importantly, SQL language queries are central to managing and querying data in pgsql. 

## Database Objects
### Table Basics
Tables are schema objects set up as a matrix grid with rows and columns. They contain data entries in rows (aka. records, etc.), while columns in a table have designated data types, eg. integer, character (single), character (varying length), text (varying length character string), date, etc. Of note, there is no constraint on the number of rows (namely, the constraint is the storage hardware), while up to ~1600 columns are allowable.

In addition to these designations, which constrain the type of data that can be entered under a given column, there are more abstract and dynamic constraints that can be applied. They are called "Primary Key", "Foreign Key", "Check", "Unique", and "Exclude" constraints, respectively. These are convenient for ensuring the database is orderly and adding implicit functionality or automation to static tables, all while providing insight into the intent of table design to database users. 

#### Key Relations
Key relations are an example of additional constraints that inform table design. In a table with a column designated as a Primary Key, the column is constrained to have unique and non-null entries. That is, records in that table cannot be repeated and cannot have a null primary key value. This is convenient for several reasons - first, it adds a constraint that keeps entries tidy and logical, and second, it allows for a many-to-one relation with other tables via a Foreign Key designation, which is convenient for structuring data queries. 

To demonstrate, the Grady Lab database includes two patient records tables: a colonoscopies table, and a separate polyp records table. In the colonoscopies table, the encounter date (or date of colonoscopy procedure) is a designated Primary Key. This is because, for that table, only one row per colonoscopy is allowed. In the polyp records table however, there can be multiple records for multiple polyps described in a single colonoscopy. Since each polyp has an assciated colonoscopy, we designate the encounter date to be a Foreign Key, which introduces a relation to the encounter date in the colonoscopies table, or the Primary Key (see figure).

![The key relation between two hypothetical tables, one for colonoscopies and another for recorded polyps. The colonoscopy/ecounter date has the constraint of 'Primary Key' in the colonoscopies table (all dates unique, and must be non-null for every row), while in the polyps table it has the 'Foreign Key' (many entries possible for one colonoscopy).](keyrelation_clip.JPG)

#### Inheritance
Inheritance establishes a dynamic relation between tables, and when used effectively can add a degree of automation that is highly convenient for rich datasets. This is also one of several types of dependancy relations that can exist in a pgsql database.

Inheritance between two discrete tables implies a parent-to-child relationship, where the child inherits all or some of the columns from the parent table. The parent table is populated with any records added in the child table. Modifications such as deletions of records in either the parent or child will then cascade into the other table linked by the dependancy. 

Child tables can inherit columns from other children, which establishes a link back to the parent for the second child (eg. record additions to the second child will manifest in the parent). Additionally, multiple children can inherit from the same parent table. It is important to note, however, that the parent will include all records from all children, so if there are redundancies among the child tables, then they can all manifest in the parent, which can quickly make the parent table difficult to manage. 

One potentially effective use of inheritance is where the parent table is a simple index of all types of all patient records. That is, a single patient may have multiple records, for example these might include colonoscopy records, individual polyp records, or cohort-collected data (eg. from separate questionnaires or followup encounters independent of any colonoscopy). See figure for a scheme of such a setup.  

![Hypothetical inheritance structure using aforementioned colonoscopies and polyps tables as children to an aggregate index or data inventory table. Note missingness is allowed based on which table an entry comes from. In practice, project id could be included in the polyps table to avoid missingness for polyp entries in the inventory.](inheritance.JPG)

# II. Practical Information
## Setting Up The Connection (For Hutch databases)
The Hutch now hosts lab servers (or "database containers") on the local gizmo clusters. These are then backed up periodically.  

### PostgreSQL Clients
#### Database Creation and Superuser Access

The following describes initial setup, with implicit superuser access for the database creator. Skip further down for details on setting up users with restricted access and logging in as such a user.

To connect to a database, first make sure a database container has been created through Hutch [MyDB](https://mydb.fredhutch.org/login). Store the user identification and password for later use, as you will later connect to the server/container as a client with superuser access.

Next, install [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to your local harddrive. The former is the main system with certain essential modules and scripts that extend functionality. The latter is a widely-used GUI for managing postgreSQL databases, and includes highly useful options for data viewing, import/export, management, etc. while conveniently displaying underlying SQL code for user GUI interactions.   

Set up a connection as a pgSQL client in pgAdmin by:  
1. Right click 'servers' in lefthand menu, then Create>Servers  
2. In popup window, select Connection tab  
3. In connection tab, populate the entries with:  
A. Host name (eg. "mydb")  
B. Port (eg. 12345)  
C. Maintenance Database (eg. "name-of-database")  
D. Username   
E. Password  
4. Save.  
  
You should have a connection to the database server hosted on the Hutch gizmo clusters.   

To start accessing databases, schemas, tables, etc. select the server name then go to:
Databases > select desired database > Schemas > select desired schema or default 'public' schema > select/right-click Tables

#### User Creation and Restricted Access

(TBD)
  
## Using pgAdmin to Manage Data
The following describes how to approach data management in the pgAdmin GUI. 

### Setting up the Binary Path
Many essential features in pgAdmin require access to modules initially installed with postgreSQL. To ensure pgAdmin can access these, Click File>Preferences>Paths>Binary Paths
Enter the local path to the directory with the modules, eg. by default: `r paste0("C:\\\\Program Files\\\\PostgreSQL\\\\9.6\\\\bin")`

### Importing and Exporting Excel .csv Files

Via pgAdmin, postgreSQL handles Excel quite well by default. Certain variables are reformatted automatically, such as dates, when they are imported. However, it should be possible to import a table with minimal modification to the cell attributes in Excel. 
That is, on import the Excel csv columns will be made to conform to the pre-specified column attributes in the destination postgreSQL table.  

That said, here are the general steps to take to import a csv from Excel:  
1. Either verify a postgreSQL table exists or make a new postgreSQL table that will be the destination table for the Excel data. This will involve specification of the column classes or data types, as well as a specific name for each column and an explicit column order.    

![Setting config for importing Excel .csv files. Note that import must be selected, format must be '.csv', header should be selected, and delimiter must be changed to ','. Finally, select only the columns in the table using the Columns tab.](csv_importoptions.jpg) 

2. Make sure the Excel file to import matches the format of the destination postgreSQL table.
Namely, make sure:   
A. The excel file only contains columns corresponding to those in the destination table, 
B. All columns are in the same order as the destination table  
C. Data formatting doesn't violate any of the column class restraints in the destination table (eg. if a column is "integer" then no entries like "123a")  

3. Once the csv is properly formatted, navigate to the table in pgAdmin, right click and select "Import/Export". On the window, select the parameters to match the Figure (Fig#).
Next, select the  Columns tab and deselect all the columns except the ones in your excel file and destination table. The only columns left should correspond to your data columns, and these should be listed in the same order as in the csv and table. 

4. Click 'Ok.'

# III. Technical Information for Dynamic Data Access Framework
## Intro. to SQL

(TBD)

Note: there are no inherent order to rows (aka. 'tuples' or 'records') for data storage, and thus one needs to specify in SQL search if order is important for query. 

## Non-table Schema Objects
In addition to tables, there are several ephemera not related to static stored data which are unique to object-relational management systems. These include column indecies, views, and functions.

When dealing with rich datasets encompassing medical records, cohort clinical data, lab sample records, and downstream analytical platform records, framing a simple question can become complicated when translated into a scripted query.
This necessitates a well designed static data storage layout that is conducive to these kinds of queries. 

### VIEWS
Views are one primary way that such queries are possible in the postgreSQL system. They are objects in the schema assembled by "definitions", which is essentially a SQL query or script. The advantage of Views is they are dynamic. That is, when their referent data is updated, they too can be rerun and updated to reflect those changes. It is extremely convenient that the defining script is stored with the pseudo-table, and therefore can be rerun as desired, even by a user not versed in SQL. 

The above leads to a need for iterative use and reuse of View definition scripts. That is, to ensure efficient data storage and maximize utility, scripts should be frames as generally as possible, such that the filtering criteria can be modified without changing the underlying code for the query.

For instace, one script might address the following query: 

####"List all patients with at least two recorded colonoscopies, where polyps were found on only the index, and whose age is at least 70 years old."

This should be translated to a View that filters on:   
1. number of patient colonoscopies >=2;   
2. number of polyps at index >0;   
3. number of polyps at second (later) colonoscopy = 0;   
and 4. age >= 70.  

The specific qualifiers ">=2", ">0", "0", and ">=70" should thus be treated as variables when writing the view definition, such that subsequent queries for 80 year old or 60 year olds with at least 3 colonoscopies or at least 1 polyp on followup could make use of the same or similar View definition, with minimal alterations.  

At a later date, these qualifiers could be treated as variables in a wrapper function for a user interface (eg. a shiny application).
